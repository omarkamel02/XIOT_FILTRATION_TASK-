-----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------
Architectur Components:

LED: I used the led that is built in the arduino for simplicity it is on pin 13 
-------------------------------------------
Switch: the switch takes the ground from the arduino and the 3.3 v from the arduino and has an input pin to the arduino 
on pin 2
-------------------------------------------
Sensor: I used LM35 temprature sensor 
it takes the ground and 3.3 v from the arduino and has it's input pin to the arduino is on pin A1
-------------------------------------------


You can run yhe code through opening the arduino IDE and uploading the .ino file to the arduino 
ehen you press the switch the the led should be on ,pressing again will set it off
 the arsuino will be printing the temprature from the sensor every 3 sexonds
