-----------------------------------------
Architectur Components:

LED: I used the led that is built in the arduino for simplicity it is on pin 13 
-------------------------------------------
Switch: the switch takes the ground from the arduino and the 3.3 v from the arduino and has an input pin to the arduino 
on pin 2
-------------------------------------------
Sensor: I used LM35 temprature sensor 

It takes the ground and 5 v from the arduino and has it's input pin to the arduino is on pin A1
